**"Too expensive"**
→ "I understand. Let me ask - how much are you currently spending on Slack, Trello, Harvest, and Zoom combined? Most teams find TechFlow actually saves them money by consolidating tools."

**"We don't have time to switch"**
→ "Totally understand. That's why we handle the entire migration for you. We import your existing projects, train your team, and guarantee zero downtime. Most teams are fully migrated in under a week."

**"We need to think about it"**
