# Audio Files Directory

This directory stores temporarily generated audio files for AI phone calls.

## Purpose
- Stores MP3 audio files generated by ElevenLabs
- Used by Twilio `<Play>` verb during phone calls
- Files are publicly accessible via HTTP

## File Naming
- Format: `call-audio-{uuid}.mp3`
- Example: `call-audio-523b3805-3f1c-41c6-b1cc-d0c474b3e0fa.mp3`

## Cleanup
- Files older than 1 hour are automatically deleted
- Manual cleanup: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cleanup/audio -H "Authorization: Bearer cleanup-secret"`
- Cleanup runs automatically during call processing

## File Sizes
- Typical size: 50-200 KB per file
- Duration: 5-15 seconds per file
- Format: MP3, 44.1kHz

## Security
- Files are publicly accessible (required for Twilio)
- No sensitive information in filenames
- Automatic cleanup prevents accumulation
- Files are gitignored

## Production Notes
For production deployment, consider:
1. Moving to cloud storage (S3, Cloudinary)
2. Using CDN for faster delivery
3. Implementing rate limiting
4. Adding monitoring for storage usage
